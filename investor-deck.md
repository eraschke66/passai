The Problem

Students waste hours creating study materials that don't work

The reality:

. spend countless hours highlighting textbooks and making flashcards they never review

. Have mountains of course materials but no system to turn it into knowledge

. Current tools (Quizlet, ChatGPT, Notion Al) are fragmented and generic

The gaps:

. Don't understand curriculum-specific requirements

. Fail to track progress or adapt to individual weaknesses

. Gamification (badges, streaks) has lost its effectiveness

Teachers struggle too: Can't easily create assessments from their own lecture materials
The Solution

PassAl transforms any document into personalized, adaptive quizzes

Upload anything:
PDFs | Slides | Handwritten notes | Study guides | Past tests

Get intelligent quizzes that:

Adapt to what you're getting wrong

Link back to source material for targeted review
Track your weak areas with analytics

Use spaced repetition for long-term retention

Monitor your psychological relationship with the material
Product: Upload Flow

Students upload their actual course materials

Class notes (handwritten or typed)
Textbook pages and chapters
Lecture slides

Teacher's study guides

Past quizzes and tests

Personal study materials

y Pro tip featured in app:

"Upload the teacher's emphasis! If your teacher said 'This will definitely be on the test,' add a note about it."
Product: Adaptive Intelligence

Three features that drive real learning:

Understanding over memorization

Questions test deep conceptual understanding, not rote recall

Adaptive difficulty

Questions adjust in real-time as students improve

Instant feedback with source linking

Every answer connects back to original material for immediate review
Product: Progress Dashboard

Students see exactly where they stand

Real-time assessment:

50% pass probability (calculated using integrated Bayesian inference)
Countdown to test date
Materials uploaded and processed
Quiz completion tracking

. Weak areas requiring focus

Psychological engagement:

. Growth Garden visualization (not badges or streaks)

. students cultivate a garden that reflects their emotional relationship with the subject

. Research shows students are fatigued by traditional gamification
Product: Personalized Study Plans

Al generates custom study schedules

Data inputs: Adaptive recommendations:
. lime until test . Daily study time allocation

Current knowledge gaps Quiz frequency

Past performance patterns Concept review priorities

Optimal study intervals .~ Optimal review timing (review material at increasing

intervals for maximum retention)
How It Works

Simple three-step process

1. Upload
   Students drop any document into PassAl (PDF, DOCX, PowerPoint, images)

2. Al Processing

Extracts text from all formats
Identifies key concepts

Generates curriculum-aligned questions using OpenAl models

3. Adaptive Learning

. students take quizzes that adjust to performance

. Review weak areas with direct source links

. \_ Irack progress with Bayesian probability updates
